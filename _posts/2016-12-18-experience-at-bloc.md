title: My experience with Bloc so far. 
---

Let me start from the beginning of being thwarted towards being part of the U.S. work force.

I had finished my degree studies in December 2008, and as the year turned, in February 2009 I had officially received my Masters Degree from an Ivy League school. I was very proud, as well as very worried because of the economic recession that the country had found itself in.

I searched and searched and searched without much luck. I was looking for an engineering job. I had gotten my degree in Electrical Engineering, and had avoided programming during my coursework like the plague. I coded only in Matlab, and focused mostly on a lot of heavy mathematical concepts during my courses there. Communication Theory, Game Theory, Modulation Techniques, Cryptography, Stochastic Processes.

It was a lot of fun, but it was very frustrating to find that every employer was looking for something just out of my reach. They were looking for the perfect candidate. Because of the economy, it was not difficult to find great candidate material, and get them to work for peanuts.

But this isn't about that. This is about my experience with Bloc.

Let me fast forward a bit. After working at 3 companies in the past 6 years, and being part of a rollercoaster ride of an acquisition, I was left a bit ragged.

I had focused on Fiber Optics, as well as Layer 2/Layer 3 devices. This type of hardware is boring, and to be quite frank, doesn't really differentiate well in the market. The big players are huge, the small players all have interesting products, but are unproven in terms of reliability.

So, in the back of my mind, all this time, I was telling myself, I can do better.

My experience at Bloc has been great. Mainly because it is focused. All the work that we've done, is given in the context of production. Let me explain.

The first Module set the groundwork for the rest of the projects. There was a lot of information. All this is necessary to move forward to the projects. But there was always someone there to ask, talk to about code, shoot back and fourth about problems they've had, problems I've encountered, and also talk about the real world.

Secondly, there is also the "wake up" call that at the end of this, you're going to have to search for a job. That is incorporated quite well, and it's good to have that churning in the back of your head. Looking at verticals, finding what you like, what you don't like, find what you gravitate towards, then also start to look at meetups, places where you can actually get a face to face with someone and talk about wanting to break into programming and being a software developer. 

During my Masters, a professor said of assigning us 1 hour of research of the end term project on the first day of class that it was beneficial to start thinking about this as soon as the course started. Even if you don't have anything chosen by the 2nd week, it'll be in the back of your head subconciously. Once  you have your topic, if you continue to work bit by bit, same thing, you'll continue to think about this subconciously and move towards acheiving that goal. 

Also, Mentors are great. They are there to guide you through the pain, and help out as much as they can. I enjoy the interactions I've had with Kevin Lowe and Phil Spitler. They have been great, patient mentors to me so far, and want to continue to work with t hem.

Finally, I have to say that the pace, although tight and time demanding, allows me to actually WORK! while achieving this professional level of coding expertise!

When I started to search for bootcamps, I had a 'coming to Jesus' moment. I had been 'separated' (their words, not mine) from my job at the acquiring company and was left with a decision as to where to go next.

I had always desired to work as a programmer, in something open source related, and make improvements to computer network and telecom industries.

This was my chance. However, the bootcamps that I had ran into were way to intensive. I couldn't give up earning an income just to do an 80+ hour a week bootcamp, then start searching for a job! That would require at least 6-8 months of funding on my part.

So far Bloc has been great in many ways, since it is helping me get these last steps in acheving the exact skills I need to become a professional software developer, that I couldn't pick up from other methods of study such as Coursera, or from my academic background.

I hope this wasn't too boring for those reading. Thanks for your eyeballs and time!
